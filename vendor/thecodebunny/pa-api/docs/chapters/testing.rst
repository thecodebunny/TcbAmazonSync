PHPUnit
-------

When you download PaApi it comes with some unittests. If you plan to run these tests you can do it simply by running phpunit in the project root dir.

$ cd /path/to/lib
$ phpunit
Please see http://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/index.html for more information about PHPUnit.

The tests are located in the folder: tests/. Feel free to have a look at them.
